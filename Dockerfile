does this make sense


# Use official Python runtime as base image
FROM python:latest

# Set environment variables
ENV PYTHONUNBUFFERED 1

# Create and set the working directory in the container
WORKDIR /app

# Copy the requirements file first to leverage Docker cache
COPY requirements.txt /app/

# Install Python dependencies
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt

# Copy only the necessary files into the container
COPY saufbot.py /app/
COPY pictures /app/pictures

# Command to run the Python application
CMD ["python", "saufbot.py"]
